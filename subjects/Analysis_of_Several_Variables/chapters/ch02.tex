\chapter{INTEGRATION: RIEMANN AND DARBOUX}

For the one-dimensional integration, we studied how to compute the length of curves, the area under a curve, and even antiderivatives. Our aim, now, is to extend these concepts to higher dimensions; given a function $f:O_{n} \to \R$, we want to give meaning to $\int_{O_{n}} f d\ast$, and fill the $\ast$ too.
